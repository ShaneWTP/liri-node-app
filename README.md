# **liri-node-app**

The LIRI bot is a node application that allows the user to display information based on the command line inputs.

The user may look for data such as:

1. Concert events for an artist

2. Song information on Spotify

3. Movie information

4. Randomly generated information from any of the previous 3 categories.

In order to use the application you must first type the the words "node" and then "liri.js". These will both let the terminal know that you are accessing this LIRI bot application.
